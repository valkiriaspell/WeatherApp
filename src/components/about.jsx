        <p>Hi! My name is Valkiria Salerno, I live in Argentina, and I designed this little weather app while I was practicing React.jsx <br></br>
        I'm on my way to be a dedicated Front End Developer and UI/UX designer.<br></br> Those are my passions. <br></br>feel free to use the weather function and contact me at any time if you want. I will be adding more details and improvements whenever I can. </p> 
        <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
